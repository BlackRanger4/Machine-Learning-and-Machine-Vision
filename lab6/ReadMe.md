# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 6: Extracting Key Points with SIFT

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV6.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 6: Extracting Key Points with SIFT** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab focuses on feature extraction techniques, particularly **Difference of Gaussians (DOG)** and the **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** for detecting and describing key points in images.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image
- Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-image seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV6.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to extract and visualize key points using SIFT.

## Features
- **Difference of Gaussians (DOG) for blob detection**
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for key point detection**
- **Visualization of detected key points**
- **Feature matching using SIFT descriptors**
- **Applications of SIFT in object recognition and image stitching**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how **SIFT detects key points that remain invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes**, making it a powerful technique for feature-based image analysis.
