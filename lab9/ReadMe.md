# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 9: MLP and CNN

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV9.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 9: MLP and CNN** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab focuses on the implementation of **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification**.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch (optional)
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow torch opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV9.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to implement and analyze deep learning models.

## Features Covered
- **Introduction to MLP and CNN**
- **Implementation of MLP for image classification**
- **Building a CNN architecture from scratch**
- **Training, evaluation, and visualization of results**
- **Comparison of MLP and CNN performance**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs over MLPs for image classification tasks. Due to computational constraints, training was performed on Google Colab.
