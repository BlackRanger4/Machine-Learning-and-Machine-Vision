# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 7: LBP, Gabor, and HOG Features

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV7.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 7: LBP, Gabor, and HOG Features** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab covers widely used feature extraction techniques in image processing and computer vision.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image
- Seaborn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-image seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV7.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to extract and analyze image features.

## Features Covered
- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for texture analysis**
- **Gabor Filters for edge and texture detection**
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for object recognition**
- **Feature visualization and interpretation**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how LBP, Gabor, and HOG extract robust features for classification and recognition tasks in image processing.
