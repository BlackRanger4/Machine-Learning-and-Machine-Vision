# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV4.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 4: Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab explores the **theory and implementation of SVMs** for classification tasks, including the use of **kernel functions** to handle non-linearly separable data.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV (for image processing, if applicable)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV4.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to implement and evaluate SVMs.

## Features
- **Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
- **Hard-margin vs. Soft-margin SVMs**
- **Kernel functions (Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid)**
- **Hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma, kernel choice)**
- **Visualization of decision boundaries**
- **Comparison of SVM performance on different datasets**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how **SVMs can classify high-dimensional data** effectively and how different **kernel functions impact decision boundaries** and classification performance.
