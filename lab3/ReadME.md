# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 3: LDA with PCA

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV3.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 3: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. The lab explores **dimensionality reduction** using PCA and **classification** using LDA.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV (for image processing)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV3.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to apply PCA and LDA on datasets.

## Features
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** for classification
- **Visualization of PCA and LDA transformations**
- **Comparison of classification performance before and after dimensionality reduction**
- **Eigenvalue analysis and visualization of decision boundaries**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how LDA improves classification performance after PCA-based feature reduction.
