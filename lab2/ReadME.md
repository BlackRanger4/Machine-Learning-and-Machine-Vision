# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 2: Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV2.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 2: Linear Regression** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab focuses on implementing **linear regression** models and analyzing their performance using visualization techniques.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV2.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to implement linear regression and analyze results.

## Features
- Implements **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression**
- Uses **Gradient Descent** for optimization
- Visualizes data and regression lines
- Evaluates model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score**
- Supports **3D visualization for multi-variable regression**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression for different datasets and provides insights into model accuracy and predictive capabilities.
