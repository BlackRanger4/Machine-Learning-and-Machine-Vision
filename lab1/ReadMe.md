# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 1: Basic Component Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV1.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for the first lab in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. The focus of this lab is on **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** applied to facial images.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV1.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to apply PCA on facial images.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses facial images
- Implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Visualizes eigenfaces and reconstruction results

## Results
The notebook demonstrates PCA-based dimensionality reduction and face reconstruction.
