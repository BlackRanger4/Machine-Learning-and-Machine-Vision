# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 8: Optical Flow

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV8.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 8: Optical Flow** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab covers motion estimation techniques in computer vision.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image
- Seaborn

Install them using:
