# Machine Vision Learning - Lab 5: Smoothing, Convolution, Gradient, and Edge Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the `MLV5.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook for **Lab 5: Smoothing, Convolution, Gradient, and Edge Detection** in the Machine Vision Learning course at **Sharif University of Technology**, instructed by **Dr. H. Mohammad Zadeh**. This lab explores various **image processing techniques**, including **smoothing filters, convolution operations, gradient computations, and edge detection methods**.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image
- Seaborn

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib scikit-image seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MLV5.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to apply various image processing techniques.

## Features
- **Image smoothing techniques** (Gaussian Blur, Median Filtering, Bilateral Filtering)
- **Convolution operations** with different kernels
- **Gradient-based methods** (Sobel, Prewitt, Scharr operators)
- **Edge detection algorithms** (Canny, Laplacian, Roberts Cross)
- **Comparison of different edge detection methods on sample images**
- **Visualization of filtered and edge-detected images**

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how different **smoothing filters** affect image quality, how **convolution kernels** can highlight different image features, and how **edge detection algorithms** can extract object boundaries effectively.
